âœ… Task-02 Completed: Stopwatch Web ApplicationâŒš

During my internship at Prodigy Infotech, I worked on Task-02 which involved building a Stopwatch Web Application. I developed this project as a web application using HTML, CSS, as well as JavaScript.

ðŸ’»I understood the main skills needed in this project were: webpage structuring using HTML, styling a webpage using CSS to give a responsive and modern look, and creating the main functions of the stopwatch in JavaScript.

This project provided a real-world application of my previous practices on DOM styling, handling events, and real-time rendering prerequisites. The project also included building a lap feature, which enhanced my skills on dynamically controlling and showing user data.

âœ¨In summary, I improved my programming and user interface experience. I look forward to more sophisticated projects and building on what I learned through this task.
